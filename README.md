The data available here consist of:
1) The source codes for estimating the IHA indicators,
2) The code for reservoir simulation using fuzzy rule curve-based hedging strategy,
3) The code for PCA
4) output results obtained from the proposed P-S-O framework
5) Supplementary data that supports the manuscript

The source code of the search engine, Borg MOEA, used in this research work is obtained from its developers on personal request, and hence cannot be shared.
